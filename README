This is my simple project game. Created for learn pyGame module and Python.
You will need pygame module to play.
To start the game just type in console: python game.py. 
I used python 3.6.5 version to inperpret this code.

HOW TO PLAY?
-> Navigation:
	a - left side
	d - right side
	a or b + space - fast move 

You start with 3 lives, and your mission is to collect as many bottles as you can. Good Luck! :) 

I used sounds from https://www.noiseforfun.com/ website.
